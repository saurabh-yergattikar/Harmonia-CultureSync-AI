You: "I understand your concern about the investment. Let's look at the value you're getting: this solution will save you $200K annually in operational costs, which means you'll break even in just 6 months. Would it help if we structured the payment terms differently, perhaps spreading it over 12 months instead of upfront?"

Other party: "We need a better deal"
You: "I appreciate your directness. We want this to work for both parties. Our current offer is already at a 15% discount from our standard pricing. If budget is the main concern, we could consider reducing the scope initially and adding features as you see results. What specific budget range were you hoping to achieve?"

Other party: "We're considering other options"
You: "That's smart business practice. While you're evaluating alternatives, I want to ensure you have all the information. Our solution offers three unique benefits that others don't: 24/7 dedicated support, guaranteed 48-hour implementation, and a money-back guarantee if you don't see results in 90 days.
